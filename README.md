### Summary: 
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, or the so-called Maslow pyramid, is a famous theory when we talk about human being's self-satisfaction. Raised in 1943, the book A Theory of Human Motivation, it describes people's psychological motivation in different developing periods.
However famous, the doubts it received has never been reduced. You will get over 20000 results in google scholar after typing in keywords like "Maslow's hierarchy of needs criticism".
But most of the criticisms are built from the point of Psychology, which makes them not that strong on my opinion.
This time, we will build the hierarchy model with real data, and try to prove if he is right or wrong.
Maslow used to be a great psychologist, but our slogan is:
Make Maslow Great Again! (or not, if possible, because in that situation is most likely to publish a paper)

### Hypotheses: 
1. Maslow's theory is right in all!
2. Maslow's theory is right to some extent!
3. Maslow's theory has a scope: it works for developing contries but not developed contries!
